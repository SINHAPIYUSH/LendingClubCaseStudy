- Data cleaning (cleaning missing values, removing redundant columns etc.)
- Data Analysis (univariate, bivariate analysis)
- Recommendations


## Conclusions
- People living on rent or mortgage are likely to default more, hence proper verification and scrutiny should be done for these applicants. 
- Applications stating the purpose of loan as debt consolidation, small business or credit card have high chances of default, hence proper scrutiny should be done for these applications. 
- Loans with smaller installments which less than 500 have high chances of default, hence the installment of loans could be kept high and proper scrutiny should be done for these applications accordingly. 
- Applications having mid level annual income are likely to default more, these loans should be handled with care. 
- Loans should be approved only after income source verification rather than just verification or no verification to reduced the loan defaulting. 
- Application having dti between 10-20 are likely to default more and should be considered as risky applications. 
- Applications requesting loan amount of less than 15k are likely to default more and are risky applications. 
- Applicants having 10+ years of experience or less than 1 years of experience are risky applicants. 
- Applications assigned to b & c grades based on last credit are risky applications with more chance of default. 
- Higher the loan term it is better as they have defaulted less according to dataset. Hence riskier loan should be given longer term in case there is a potential to approve the applicant. 
- Loans approved in later part of the year i.e. October-December are more likely to default and hence proper scrutiny should be done. 
- California state applications should be considered risky given they have defaulted more in the past.
